# Data-Monster

## Description 

I developed a customized Python program designed to transform my bank statements into Excel files, enabling me to enhance my budgeting and expense-tracking capabilities.

This programme has made it simpler for me to manage my finances by giving me an easy way to arrange and analyse my spending. I can now easily turn bank statements into Excel spreadsheets, which gives me a thorough picture of my spending patterns and helps me make better budgetary decisions. This tool gives me the ability to be more proactive in reaching my financial objectives while also improving my understanding of my personalÂ finances.

This project is a Python program that can take in an Excel file (.xlsx) and then do either of the following:
- Clean the data
- Analyze the data
- Visualize the data
- Export the data to a new Excel file (.xlsx)
- Export the data to a new CSV file (.csv)
